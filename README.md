# Harnessing-decentralized-and-generative-AI-for-secure-privacy-pollution-insights
 Air pollution poses a significant threat to global health, contributing to millions of deaths annually. This project presents a comparative analysis of NO, NO₂, and NOₓ levels across five capital cities in the southern states of India. The research integrates both real-world datasets and synthetic data generated using a diffusionbased generative AI model. Preprocessing techniques, including outlier removal and data visualization through heatmaps, are employed to enhance data quality and interpretability.<br> To facilitate decentralized and privacypreserving analysis, federated learning is implemented using the Flower framework, with time series deep learning models deployed across the cities. Model performance is evaluated using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics. Federated learning in environmental monitoring is implemented using the Flower Framework with time series Deep learning models precisely LSTM, GRU, LSTM_GRU, LSTM_BIGRU, GRU_BILSTM, Transformer_GRU where LSTM outperformed with R2 score of 0.7059 and 0.7542 for real data and the synthetic data.
